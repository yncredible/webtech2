>##Lab 1
Introduction to Git

Advanced CSS3 animations

We were taught how to code professional animations using CSS3.

In the Lab2 folder you will find 2 exercises:

* exercise no. 1 : Click on the square, and 2 other squares slide in
* exercise no. 2 : Some kind of "choose user" screen, but then with some cool animations

>##Lab 4
Building an app prototype using forecast.io.


In the Lab4 folder you will find 2 app prototypes:

* **weatherApp_v1**: This was my first attempt. I used it to try to understand how to the forecast api is put together. It's unfinished, as in "un-styled".
* **weatherApp_v2**: This is my finished product built on **Bootstrap**. It's a minimal weather app, based on a design I found on the internet. (***The design is included in the folder gfx***)

You can check out the finished product here: [www.yannicknijs.be/weather/](http://www.yannicknijs.be/weather/)
