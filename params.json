From this point on we have to host our projects on Github (or Bitbucket).\r\n\r\n* First exercise to collaborate on a project with Git, was to make a mini recipe website in a group of 4, with 4 different dishes. The repo of this mini-project can be found [on Jurgen's page](https://github.com/jurgb/webtechweek1) .\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n>##Lab 2\r\nAdvanced CSS3 animations\r\n\r\nWe were taught how to code professional animations using CSS3.\r\n\r\nIn the Lab2 folder you will find 2 exercises:\r\n\r\n* exercise no. 1 : Click on the square, and 2 other squares slide in\r\n* exercise no. 2 : Some kind of \"choose user\" screen, but then with some cool animations\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n>##Lab 3\r\nAdvanced javaScript: Build your own JS Framework.\r\n\r\nIn the Lab3 folder you will find a todo app, powered by a custom js Framework.\r\n\r\n***3/4/2014 UPDATE: The \"click\" functionality is still to be added later on.***\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n>##Lab 4\r\nBuilding an app prototype using forecast.io.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Lab4 folder you will find 2 app prototypes:\r\n\r\n* **weatherApp_v1**: This was my first attempt. I used it to try to understand how to the forecast api is put together. It's unfinished, as in \"un-styled\".\r\n* **weatherApp_v2**: This is my finished product built on **Bootstrap**. It's a minimal weather app, based on a design I found on the internet. (***The design is included in the folder gfx***)\r\n\r\nYou can check out the finished product here: [www.yannicknijs.be/weather/](http://www.yannicknijs.be/weather/)\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n>##Lab 5\r\nBuilding an app for We Are IMD: **Terrappke**\r\n\r\nIn the Lab5 folder you will find my attempt. This assignment also required the use of the forecast api. **Built on Bootstrap**\r\n\r\n***Terrappke is an app that invites passionate (future) students to the Creativity Gym terrace, to come and talk about Webdesign & Webdevelopment.***\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n>##Lab 6\r\nIntroduction to Nodejs, Express and Web sockets\r\n\r\nIn the Lab6 folder you will find my first attempt to built a nodejs application.\r\n\r\n* nodejs: Live voting on drinks\r\n* imdwall: voting on questions, built on **Bootstrap**\r\n\r\n***4/04/2014 UPDATE: It still needs some work.***\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n>##Lab 7\r\nIntroduction to Sass, a css preprocessor.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n>##Lab 8\r\nBackbone.js workshop and live coding session, hosted by District01.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
